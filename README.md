# Machine Learning Based Personalized Treatment CKD Using Multimodal Clinical Data and Patient Profiling
 Developed a personalized treatment recommendation system for CKD patients using multimodal clinical data and
patient profiling. Applied machine learning algorithms to predict disease progression and recommend tailored treatment
plans. Aimed to support clinical decision-making by enhancing accuracy and individualization of care.
- Used Python, Pandas, and NumPy for preprocessing multimodal clinical data — cleaning, transforming, and
integrating patient records for analysis.
- Applied Machine Learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, KNN) using Scikit-learn to predict CKD progression
and generate personalized treatment recommendations based on patient profiles. %.
- Utilized Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook to visualize patient data trends, model performance, and present clinical
insights interactively for decision support
